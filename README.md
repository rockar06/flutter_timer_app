# flutter_timer_bloc_app

A new Flutter application to show the usage of Bloc library in a Timer  
application

## Getting Started

Here you can find the documentation for the tutorial:

- [Flutter Timer Tutorial](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/fluttertimertutorial)

NOTE: The [waves library](https://pub.dev/packages/wave) used in this
project, has an issue if we are using null safety in Flutter, until
this [PR](https://github.com/i-protoss/wave/pull/25) is not merged to
master branch, a workaround is modifying the `CustomConfig` file from
local resources as show [here](https://github.com/i-protoss/wave/blob/0377d3b06b8df762d481e64bf4057d73fdafdaa2/lib/config.dart)
